CSCE 3513 - Personal Repository for cloud storage and reference.
Our project was an online shopping system with a log in system and individual carts for the users.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints we were not able to get the project finished during the semester.
Our work was graded on a presentation/individual level rather than on the project as a whole, thus getting it fully compatible and online was not a requirement.
I spent most of my time working on the front end as well as client side routing.
